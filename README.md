# React with Tailwind

Professional, production-ready starter combining Create React App and Tailwind CSS.

A small, fast React application scaffolded for component-driven development with Tailwind CSS utility classes, ready for production builds and simple PWA/support (optional service worker). This repository contains basic page placeholders (OrderPage, ProductPage) and a minimal service worker registration helper so builds succeed out of the box.

---

## Key highlights

- Modern React (Create React App) project structure
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Production-ready build via `react-scripts build`
- Minimal service worker registration (optional, safe fallback)
- Placeholder pages (OrderPage, ProductPage) so the app compiles even before content is implemented
- Windows-friendly commands and troubleshooting tips

## Tech stack

- React (Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS
- PostCSS (via CRA)
- Node.js & npm

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended) and npm
- Git (optional)
- PowerShell or a terminal

Verify:

```powershell
node -v
npm -v
```

### Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)

- From the project root (C:\projects\react-with-tailwind):

1. Install dependencies

```
npm ci
# or
npm install
```

2. Start development server

```
npm start
```

3. Create a production build

```
npm run build
```

4. Serve the production build locally (optional)
   Install a static server if you want to preview the production build:

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

#### Development workflow

- Work in src/ — components, pages and styles live here.
- Tailwind styles are applied in src/index.css (or equivalent entry CSS). If you change Tailwind config you may need to restart the dev server.
- When adding new pages/components, place them under src/pages or src/components and import them by relative path.

##### Recommended pattern:

- Small, focused components
- Reusable UI in src/components
- Page-level containers in src/pages

#### Build & deploy

- Build optimized assets:

```
npm run build
```

- Deploy the contents of /build to your static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3, etc.).
  If you enable the service worker (optional), follow host-specific guidelines for caching and invalidation. The project includes a minimal src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js which registers a worker only in production and only when supported.

#### Project structure (typical)

src/

- index.js — app entry
- index.css — Tailwind base + custom styles
- serviceWorkerRegistration.js — minimal register/unregister helper
- pages/ - OrderPage.js — placeholder page - ProductPage.js — placeholder page
  components/ — shared components (create as needed)
  public/
  - index.html
  - favicon, manifest, static assets
    package.json
